*In brief:*

Most popular beehives and thus the ones that this project will cover are Langstroth hives and Dadant Blatt behives.

The project will monitor their:

- Weight of the hive monitoring (useful for amount of bees and honey amount)
- Automatic syrup supplementation if needed
- Temperature and humidity (needs to be optimal)
- Noise level in the hive
- Self-cleaning IR camera to monitor the hive and the honey cells
- WiFi / LTE interconnection for multiple hives
- Android application for easy access to data and database to manage the numerical data with easy input

All embedded in the hive roof, with built in solar panel and a battery pack (3s2p 21700)



When bees become anxious, their movement and noises increase. In summer, they flap their wings to cool off the hive. So, if we provide them with both comfort and comfortable hive, they can focus solely on the honey production. Keep in mind, too, that bees are almost fully instinctual animals, so they won't forget things like humans do. If they suddenly become hot two years after this system is installed and they've been hatched in a comfortable enviroment - they will instinctually flap their wings to cool the hive.

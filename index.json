[{"content":" Preface # I first came across the Luča project a few years back via news sites. :)\nI followed the project, but the lanuch alas got postponed a few times and I.. Forgot about it.. rip.\nUntil one day I saw on the news!\nLuča got launched! Woo!!!\nI instantly looked for my 70cm turnstile and I realized - I had left it at the radio club!\nThe opportunity was too good to pass and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like waiting a few days I decided to just roll with old school v-dipole and SAW filter + LNA into old trusty rtlsdr. :) (I did actually recieve it later with turnstile as well :P)\nAnd.. it worked!\nI captured GMSK bursts:\nGMSK Bursts They occur approximately ever 80 seconds The satellite whitepaper has not been published yet, but it has been hinted it's using AX25 4k8 GMSK. I did successfully decode it with GNURadio blocks first, but the data was a bit tough to extract, it could be done with `strings` though. Gnuradio example: # and I got the output:\nContainer: header = Container: addresses = ListContainer: Container: callsign = u'R2ANF' (total 5) ssid = Container: ch = False ssid = 0 extension = False Container: callsign = u'RS90S' (total 5) ssid = Container: ch = False ssid = 1 extension = True control = 0x00 pid = 0xF0 info = b'FB\\x02\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x19\\x00\\r\\x00\\xff|\"\\x19W\\x0e0{Si\\x8b(\\x02\\x00`\\t\\x00\\x00(\\x00\\x00\\x1f\\x00!\\xed\\x04\\x00\\x01\\x000\\x00\\x0c\\x10E\\x0cU\\x13u\\x00%\\x00M\\x00F\\x00\\x00\\x000\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x8a\\x03q\\x029\\x03\\xaf\\x03\\x00@\\x00\\x00\\x08\\x1f\\x1f)\\x02\\x00\\xb4!\\x97Zb\\x0c' (total 89) Though do keep in mind this turned out to be 2k4 FSK USP\nWhat about SSTV and charged particle sensor? # Well.. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see anyting else in the signal, nor was a whitepaper published about all of Luča\u0026rsquo;s downlinks, so we wait for some info :)\nAnd\u0026hellip; an update also awaits us in the thought of SSTV commencing/commanding! :) As well as about the particle sensor it carries.. Would be very nice to be able to get that data as well..\nLater I did get confirmed that the satellite operators in Montenegro Space Agency have to manually trigger SSTV. Charged particle sensor probably has a downlink somewhere, but curiosity remains on which frequency it is. Might be S band, that was common with previous Cubesats.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the story of Luča! Very nice cubesat! Hope montengro launches many more! Awesome project ;D\n","date":"30 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/recieving-luca-satellite/","section":"Blogs","summary":"As Montenegro soared into space with their own first Cubesat 1U satellite, I attempt and successfully recieve it\u0026rsquo;s telemetry GMSK data and decode it!

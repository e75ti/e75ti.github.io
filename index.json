[{"content":" Requirements: # adb rooted phone / AnBox virtual machine Read all of this so you understand what\u0026rsquo;s being done, don\u0026rsquo;t copy paste commands without fully reading as you don\u0026rsquo;t need all of them.\n~$ adb devices ~$ adb root (and run adb remount after root if it runs successfully) If you have issues with root, do:\n~$ adb shell ~$ su Then you can pull data with this trick: Well, you have to do a few commands, as I don\u0026rsquo;t believe it will work in one.\nYou need to do:\nadb shell su cd /data/path/of/file cp /data/path/of/file/copyme /data/local/tmp chown -R shell.shell /data/local/tmp/copyme exit exit adb pull /data/local/tmp/copyme /destination/copyme Do not forget to remove /data/local/tmp/copyme after pull\nshell.shell is owner.group. When you copy a file using SU, the owner and group will be root.root.\nThe adb pull command runs as shell.shell and will not be able to pull the file from the temporary location. Changing it before doing pull will allow you permission.\nAdb pull your /sdcard and /data/data/com.viber.voip (com.viber.voip either directly if you can get adb root or if you can\u0026rsquo;t do the trick above).\nGood job, we have finished the backing up portion. Now onto the restoring portion.\nLog into viber on your new phone - device and just repeat everything but adb push data back in.\nTodo later, will add the VM portion: # So far the idea is to have an Anbox (if possible) or Android in VM to restore from gdrive to, then pull data out of it (selfhosted of course and open source so that the community can audit code since this program has a potential to be privacy intensive you know) ","date":"24 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/whatsapp-and-viber-restoration/","section":"Blogs","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever needed to fetch your WhatsApp or Viber database, this is how you can do it directly from the phone or from the hidden Google Drive, this is how you can do it!

In summer, they flap their wings to cool off the hive. So, if we provide them with both comfort and comfortable hive, they can focus solely on the honey production. Keep in mind, too, that bees are almost fully instinctual animals, so they won\u0026rsquo;t forget things like humans do. If they suddenly become hot two years after this system is installed and they\u0026rsquo;ve been hatched in a comfortable enviroment - they will instinctually flap their wings to cool the hive.\n","date":"24 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/beehive-automation/","section":"Blogs","summary":"A practical way to automate some of the major questions that beekeepers face with their hives in regards to health, temperature and needs of the bees, as well as their productivity and honey health!","title":"Automating beehives with sensors","type":"blog"},{"content":"To be added.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Tuco Imad","summary":"","title":"About me","type":"page"},{"content":"To be added.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cv/","section":"Tuco Imad","summary":"","title":"My resume","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Blogs","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Tuco Imad","summary":"","title":"Tuco Imad","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
